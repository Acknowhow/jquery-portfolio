<h2>jQuery-Portfolio</h2>

<p>This plugin helps you display and organize your portfolio pieces in a clean & slick fashion. Easy to set up and get going.</p>

I originally wrote this plugin when redesigning my <a href="http://www.arsenetoumani.com">portfolio</a> and later descided to make it available for all!<br/>
Rebranding and updating our portfolios are not a fun tasks for us devs, so I thought this plugin would facilitate our task.<br/>
<b>Note:</b> I wrote this plugin in about an hour so it might be a little buggy. I'll try to patch them up with new features when I get some free time.

<h2>Demo:</h2>

View the full demo <a href="http://www.arsenetoumani.com">here</a>

<h2>Installation:</h2>

- Get both <i>portfolio.jquery.js</i> and <i>portfolio.jquery.css</i> files and include them in your html file
- Add `$("#MyPortfolio").portfolio({ options });` to your <i>script</i> tags or JS file
- Append and edit (to your liking) the HTML snippet you find in `/demo/index.html`
- That's it! Really you just have to follow what's going on in the `/demo` folder ;)

<h2>Develop:</h2>

- Clone this repo onto your desktop
- run `npm install` to install all node dependencies
- run `gulp` for CSS and JS minification

You really only need to work in the demo folder then run `gulp` later.

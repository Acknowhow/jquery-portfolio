<h1>jQuery-Portfolio</h1>

I originally wrote this plugin when redesigning my <a href="http://www.arsenetoumani.com">portfolio</a> and later descided to make it available for all!<br/>
Re-branding and updating our portfolios is not a fun task for us devs, so I thought this plugin would facilitate the task.<br/>
<b>Note:</b> I wrote this plugin in about an hour so it might be a little buggy. I'll try to patch them up with new features when I get some free time.

<h1>Demo:</h1>

View the full demo <a href="http://www.arsenetoumani.com">here</a>

<h1>Installation:</h1>

- Clone this repo onto your desktop
- run `npm install` to install all node dependencies
- run `gulp` for CSS and JS minification

You really only need to work in the demo folder then run `gulp` later.
